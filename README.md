W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with built-in responsiveness. It supports responsive mobile first design by default, and it is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.

W3.CSS can also speed up and simplify web development because it is easier to learn, and easier to use than other CSS frameworks:

## Example
```html
<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>My Header</h1>
</div>

<img src="img_car.jpg" alt="Car">

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation.</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <p>My Footer</p>
</div> 
```
> *"Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler."* Albert Einstein

## W3.CSS is Free
W3.CSS is free to use. No license is necessary.

## Usage
To use W3.CSS in your web site, just add a link to "w3.css" from your web pages:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css"> 
```
Or download w3.css from [w3css_downloads](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_downloads.asp) and add a link to w3.css:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="w3.css"> 
```

## W3.CSS Web Site Templates
There are some responsive W3CSS templates for you to use.
You are free to modify, save, share, use or do whatever you want with them:
