# W3.CSS

W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with built-in responsiveness. It supports responsive mobile first design by default, and it is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.

W3.CSS can also speed up and simplify web development because it is easier to learn, and easier to use than other CSS frameworks:

## Example
```html
<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>My Header</h1>
</div>

<img src="img_car.jpg" alt="Car">

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation.</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <p>My Footer</p>
</div> 
```
> *"Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler."* Albert Einstein


## W3.CSS is Free
W3.CSS is free to use. No license is necessary.
